# LangChain Project

This repository contains the source code for a language processing application built with Python, leveraging the PyTorch framework for implementing language models and integrating various tools for enhanced language understanding and generation capabilities.

## Features

- **Language Model Integration**: Utilizes advanced language models for understanding and generating human-like text.
- **Tool Integration**: Seamlessly integrates external tools like Tavily for specialized searches, enhancing the application's capabilities.
- **Dynamic Interaction Graph**: Employs a state graph for managing the flow of interactions, allowing for complex conversational logic.

## Installation

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/crismolav/langchain-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd langchain-project
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To start the application, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python src/lang_graph.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the application.

## Configuration

The application requires setting up environment variables for API keys. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update it with your API keys:

```dotenv
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here
```
